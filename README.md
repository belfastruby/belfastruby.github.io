### Ideas for Features or Improvements

We're open to ideas about improving the Belfast Ruby website. Here's a couple of ideas we've come up with so far. Add your own work on bringing these ideas to life.

- Update the resources page with Ruby related links that you find useful
- Have a section for links to each speaker's slides/companion notes
- Pull in related Instagram or Flickr images for each meetup

Even if you aren't interested in contributing code, we'd love if you could
suggest any ideas for improvements or let us know via GitHub Issue if you run
into any bugs.
